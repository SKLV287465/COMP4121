\textbf{Insertion:}\\
\underline{To insert $k$:}\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Search for right place to insert.
    \item Toss a coin until you get a head, and count the number of tails $t$ that you got.
    \item Insert $k$ and link it at levels 0-$t$ from the bottom up.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Deletion:}
This is the same as a standard doubly linked list, except all layers must be taken care of.\\
\textbf{Other Notes:}
\underline{Search:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The probability of getting $i$ consecutive tails when flipping a coin is $i$ times is $(\frac{1}{2})^i$.
    \item If $n$ elements belong to a set with a probability $p$ each, then the expected size of that set is $np$.
    \item Thus, an $n$ element Skip List has on average $\frac{n}{2^i}$ elements with links on level $i$.
    \item Since an element has links only on levels 0 - $i$ with probability $\frac{1}{2^{i + 1}}$, the total expected number of link levels per element is \[\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{i + 1}{2^{i + 1}} = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{i}{2^i} = 2\]
    \item Let $\#(i)$ denote the number of elements on level $i$
    \item Since the expected number of elements having a link at level $i$ is $E[\#(i)] = \frac{n}{2^i}$, by the Markov inequality, the probability of having at least one element at level $i$ satisfies $P(\#(i)\geq 1) \leq \frac{E[\#(i)]}{1} = \frac{n}{2^i}$
    \item Thus, the probability to have an element on level $2\log n$ is smaller than $\frac{n}{2^{2\log n}} = \frac{n}{2^{\log n^2} = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n}}$.
    \item More generally, the probability that level $k\log n$ is nonempty is smaller than $\frac{1}{n^{k-1}}$.
    \item The expected value $E$ OF $k$ such that $k$ is the least integer so that the number of levels is $\leq k\log n$ is \[E\leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k}{n^{k - 1}} = (\frac{n}{n - 1})^2\]
    \item Thus, the expected number of levels is barely larger than $\log n$
    \item If an element has a link at level $i$ then with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, it has link at level $i + 1$.
    \item Thus, the expected number of elements between any two consecutive elements with a link on level $i + 1$ which have links only up to level $i$ is smaller than \[\frac{0}{2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{2}{2^3} + \frac{3}{2^4} + \dots = 1\] So once on level $i$, on average we will have to inspect only two elements on that level before going to a lower level.
    \item There will be fewer than $2\log(n)$ levels to go down, with visiting on average only two elements per each level.
    \item Consequently, on average, the search will be in time $O(log(n))$.
    \item For an element with links on levels $0 - i$, we hve to store $2(i + 1)$ pointers to other elements and the expected number of elements with highest link on level $i$ is $O(\frac{n}{2^{i + 1}})$. Thus, the total expected space for all pointers doe snot exceed \[O(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}2(i + 1)\frac{n}{2^{i + 1}}) = O(2n\sum_{i = 0}^{\infty}\frac{i + 1}{2^{i + 1}}) = O(4n) = O(n)\]
    \item Unless we ensure that the worst case performance of search is $O(\log(n))$, Skip Lists are a better option than BSTs.
